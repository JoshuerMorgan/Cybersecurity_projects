# Cybersecurity Projects

Hello Hiring managers and Recruiters,

I am excited to present a collection of cybersecurity projects that I have worked on. These projects have provided me with valuable hands-on experience in various aspects of cybersecurity.

## 1. Algorithm for File Updates in Python
This project involved developing an algorithm in Python to handle file updates. The algorithm ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the files while they are being updated.

## 2. Applying Filters in SQL Queries
In this project, I applied various filters in SQL queries to retrieve specific data from a database. This project helped me understand how to query databases in SQL.

## 3. Risk Analysis
This project involved conducting a comprehensive risk analysis for a hypothetical organization. The analysis included identifying potential threats, assessing vulnerabilities, and recommending mitigation strategies.

## 4. Brute Force Incident Response Report
In response to a simulated brute force attack, I prepared an incident response report detailing the nature of the attack, the steps taken to mitigate it, and recommendations for preventing similar attacks in the future.

## 5. Control and Compliance Checklist
I created a control and compliance checklist to help an organization assess its compliance with various cybersecurity standards and regulations.

## 6. File Permissions in Linux
This project involved setting and managing file permissions in a Linux environment. I learned how to use Linux commands to control access to files and directories.

## 7. Incident Handler's Journal
I maintained a journal documenting all incidents that occurred during a specified period. The journal includes details of each incident, the response actions taken, and lessons learned.

## 8. Vulnerability Assessment Report
I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a hypothetical network and prepared a report detailing the identified vulnerabilities and recommended remediation actions.

## 9. Packet Sniffing with tcpdump and Wireshark
In this project, I used tcpdump and Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic. This project helped me understand how to detect and investigate suspicious network activity.

I look forward to discussing these projects in more detail during our conversation. Thank you for considering my application.

Best Regards,
Joshua Akeredolu
