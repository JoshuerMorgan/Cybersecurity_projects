# About me
"Hello,

My name is Joshua Akeredolu. I am a first-generation Nigerian immigrant with a major in Computer Science and an Associate degree in Computer Information System. My fascination with computers began when I saw my uncle repairing them, and I found myself wondering how the hardware functioned. My journey has not been the smoothest, as I have had to sponsor my own education through college.

I have a background in Object-Oriented Programming with JAVA, C++, and front-end Web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and REACT. Now, I am making a switch to Cybersecurity to protect people by ensuring the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of their data. The ability to thwart malicious threat actors is my motivation for cybersecurity.

My strengths lie in people analysis, time management, and programming. I am a great judge of character and can read people very well. This ability allows me to protect companies from internal threat actors. I can also analyze people in important roles in an organization to reveal and help protect their possible security vulnerabilities.

I am a curious and problem-solving oriented Cybersecurity analyst. With my skills in people analysis, time management, and programming, I actively work to analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to protect people and organizations' data confidentiality, integrity, and asset availability.

Thank you for considering my application.
